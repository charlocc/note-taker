## by Charlotte Clark 


## How to Use

```
After opening the Note Taker, you will be presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. If you click on the Notes Page button, you will be presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
You can enter a new note title and the note’s text, and a Save icon will in the navigation at the top of the page. If you would like to save the note, click the Save icon, and the note will appear in the left hand column in an existing note list. Click on the note to see it in full in the right column. If you would like to delete a note, click the trash can button. Click the "+" button to get an empty field to enter a new note.
```



## Bonus

You haven’t learned how to handle DELETE requests, but this application offers that functionality on the front end. As a bonus, try to add the DELETE route to the application using the following guideline:

* `DELETE /api/notes/:id` should receive a query parameter that contains the id of a note to delete. To delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the `db.json` file, remove the note with the given `id` property, and then rewrite the notes to the `db.json` file.



# Requirements

  * Application must be deployed to Heroku.

  * make folders with routes

  * screen shot in readme and links

  * Application allows users to delete notes.


You are required to submit BOTH of the following for review:

* The URL of the functional, deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README describing the project.
